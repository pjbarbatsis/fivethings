relates to my life and my passions. I came up with the idea that it could be a way for me 
to show off some of my favorite things, like music or video games. From there, I thought 
that it would be interesting for me to explore how music has changed my life, and express 
that in an application. The target for this application will be music lovers, or friends 
and family who are curious to know a bit more about who I am and what I like.
	
As for the design of the app, I’m going to be using relative layouts nested in a linear 
layout and wrapped in a scroll view. It would save me a lot of time to come up with style 
values for the header texts and the body texts. I would like the app to have a dark gray 
background with white text, and a green accent color. The app itself will contain little 
blurbs of my opinions on a few of my favorite albums. These albums, in no particular 
order, are “I Am a Bird Now” by Antony and the Johnsons, “Motorcade of Generosity” by 
Cake, “Untrue” by Burial, “Hurry Up, we’re Dreaming” by M83 and “Heaven or Las Vegas” by 
Cocteau Twins. To contain that information, I’m going to need an image view for the album 
cover, a header text view, a body text view and a line to visually separate the different 
records. I will also add some button views with intents to connect to music streaming 
services like Spotify or Apple Music.
