Five Albums That Changed My Life - README

* You will need JDK 8, Android SDK and Android Studio to run this application.

* The user should see a stylized list of details regarding five albums. 

* The app is scrollable, and the buttons all connect to YouTube videos.

* In the original project idea, I had thought to include views for music streaming,
but upon reading the requirements for buttons, I decided to go with intent-sending buttons
instead. 

* I also found it needlessly difficult to include music streaming services when
YouTube is much easier to implement and is more widely accessible.
